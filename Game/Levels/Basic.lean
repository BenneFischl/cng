Introduction
"
We will assume that the real numbers are a field.

# The complex numbers

We define the complex numbers, and prove that they are a ring.

We also 'extract some basic API' (e.g. we prove that
two complex numbers are equal iff they have the same
real and imaginary parts)

# Main Definitions

`zero` : the complex number 0
`one` : the complex number 1
`add` -- addition of two complex numbers
`neg` -- negation of a complex number
`mul` -- multiplication of two complex numbers

# Main Theorem

`comm_ring` : The complex numbers are a commutative ring.
